# Python Programming (Dementia Prevention Chatbot Project)
This is the result of a chatbot-related Python project.

## Motivation
I was interested in the Nintendo Mario game, so I created a Mario game app using Java in Android Studio by referring to YouTube and Google on my own.


## Project Structure
This chatbot has **time and alarm** functions, **dictionary** functions, **recording** functions, and **quiz** functions. </br></br>


## Output
1. Current date and time, medication alarm </br>
- The Korean meaning of the picture below is "The current time is 6:53. Today is June 19, 2024. Please set a medication reminder time zone. (HH:MM) 6:54
It's time to take your medicine." <a href="https://github.com/joon-hee-kim/MarioGameApp" >

</a> </br></br>

2. Dictionary, quiz </br>
- Here, the dictionary meaning of book is
- The quiz is conducted using the "quiz" command
- And if the answer is incorrect, the answer is provided.
- When the answer is entered, "Correct!" is output and the quiz ends.
- Additionally, you can end the quiz in the middle of the quiz using the "quit" command.
- And when you enter "bye", the chatbot system itself terminates.<a href="https://github.com/joon-hee-kim/MarioGameApp" >
